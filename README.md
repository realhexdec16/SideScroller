# SideScroller

We should start to try and think of other possible types of blocks we can have in the game as well. Maybe some blocks can affect his stats like make him move faster or something. 



I just went to the two levels and added a 'p' in;
that will be where the player starts

Frame:
will be 1600pixels by 1000pixels with each block
being 100 by 100 pixels

Start Panel:
start screen will open up on load
has different buttons for level select

Game Panel:
replaces Start Panel on the frame after
the level is selected

notepad files for levels:
I put together a basic level1.txt for testing
program will read in from the notepad files and
translate them so the panel knows how to paint
the level
s = nothing/sky
g = ground
n = end of the line

controls:
left/right for left/right
up/space can both be jump
