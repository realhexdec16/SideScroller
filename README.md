# SideScroller

I just went to the two levels and added a 'p' in;
that will be where the player starts

Frame:
will be 1600pixels by 1000pixels with each block
being 100 by 100 pixels

Start Panel:
start screen will open up on load
has different buttons for level select

Game Panel:
replaces Start Panel on the frame after
the level is selected

notepad files for levels:
I put together a basic level1.txt for testing
program will read in from the notepad files and
translate them so the panel knows how to paint
the level
s = nothing/sky
g = ground
n = end of the line

controls:
left/right for left/right
up/space can both be jump
