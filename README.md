# SideScroller

things to do/ideas:
- allow player to change character color/design
- more types of blocks, they could possibly
  affect the character in some way

notepad files for levels:
program will read in from the notepad files and
translate them so the panel knows how to paint
the level
s = nothing/sky
g = ground
p = player
d = door

controls:
left = left, a
right = right, d
jump = up, w, space
