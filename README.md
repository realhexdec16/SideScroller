# SideScroller

Frame:
will be 1600pixels by 1000pixels and each map 
can be 10 blocks by x blocks with each block
being 100 by 100 pixels
im going to figure out how to use a CardLayout
for this I think that's going to be the best
layout for this

Start Panel:
start screen will open up on load
has different buttons for level select

Game Panel:
replaces Start Panel on the frame after
the level is selected

notepad files for levels:
program will read in from the notepad files and
translate them so the panel knows how to paint
the level

controls:
left/right for left/right
up/space can both be jump

also if you guys ever need the documentation,
here's a helpful link:
